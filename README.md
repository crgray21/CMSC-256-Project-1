# CMSC-256-Project-1
Created a class which initializes variables for constructing an object that includes book title, book author,
and book isbn's. The class must check to make sure there are no null references so that there are no nullpointer exceptions.
There must be a method to validate that the isbn only contains numbers, and another method to validate that an object
is an instanceof another object. These methods were tested using JUnit testing.
